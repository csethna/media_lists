Regarding PR contact, Reilly explains: ""A quirk of our paper is that we don't follow the daily competition (Star Tribune, Pioneer Press) on stories. This generally means most press releases aren't very useful to us, aside from using us for a brief on our Web site. This can cause problems, as PR pros sometimes don't understand this, and get disappointed when we don't bite on a news release. This isn't necessarily a peeve, it's just something that happens.""

""Science magazines often use their own staff writers to do stories about big-press-release discoveries, or already have writers in mind; freelance pitches about that kind of story rarely work, because the magazines already know about it.
