She stresses that the paper doesn't do a lot of lifestyle pieces and focuses more on entertainment and features.

The one exception is information on travel on the Jersey Shore.

"Nicholas","Goldberg","Los Angeles Times","Editorial Page Editor","Editorial Page","","Goldberg is the Editorial Page Editor Los Angeles (CA) Times. ""There's hardly anything that we won't publish if it has an intriguing argument that will be of interest,"" he says. ""We read papers and we listen to what people are talking about; new movies, books, interesting issues and cultural debates, history, sports, family problems and business, and then we try to find the most interesting person to write that piece."" He wants commentary that is reasoned, yet opinionated, on a variety of subjects such as domestic politics, foreign policy and issues and controversies in Los Angeles, California and the world. Personal essays and humor pieces also run.[CR-LF][CR-LF]The longer shelf life a piece has, the more chance there is that it will be picked up because lead time depends on the subject. ""A Tuesday morning submission can appear in Wednesday's paper, but we don't want pieces so quickly that they're not thoughtful or don't have a big-picture view."" Pitches shouldn't be about the PR person, it is about who they represent. The point is that ""the size and nature of the institution will have an impact on the pitches success,"" he says. He always keeps an eye out for pieces from legislators and book publicists.[CR-LF][CR-LF]Daily op-eds can react to news more quickly and they are shorter, around 750 words. Sunday submissions take a step back and look at the news from the week, so they are longer, up to 1,400 words. Depth and insight are the key criteria. Pieces that react to news or are less reflective of the bigger picture should be more concise and within the daily op-ed format. ""No matter what you send, be ready to make a few adjustments before it runs,"" he says. It is better to submit pieces that are already written. If a relationship is established with an editor or columnist, pitch that person directly. Submissions must be exclusive and sent by e-mail to the department e-mail address, not to the opinion page editor. Do NOT send attachments, rather copy things into the body of an email. The paper runs three to four pieces a day. The lead time is one week.[CR-LF][CR-LF]Career:[CR-LF]2009 - present - Los Angeles Times, Editorial Page Editor[CR-LF]2008 - Los Angeles Times, Editorial Page's Deputy Editor[CR-LF]2003 - Los Angeles Times, Op-Ed Editor[CR-LF]1995 - Newsday, Middle East Correspondent[CR-LF]Newsday, Reporter covering New York statehouse[CR-LF][CR-LF]Education:[CR-LF]1980 - Harvard University, B.A. Government[CR-LF][CR-LF]Media Alert: Wednesday 23rd September 2009[CR-LF]Nicholas Goldberg has recently been appointed the Editor of the Los Angeles Times’ Editorial Pages section and will begin his new role September 28.

He covers topics on Hollywood, media, entertainment, TV, streaming, music, and more. Hollywood in Toto is open to sponsored post opportunities. He is best reached on Tuesdays between 9 AM to 3 PM via email.[CR-LF][CR-LF]Regarding pitching information, Toto states, ""I prefer email pitches. I check my email throughout the day, so it's pretty easy to reach me. I like story pitches, connections to experts in the fields I cover (entertainment). My site focuses on what other outlets aren't covering. So fresh angles will get my attention. I'm sure they all know their gigs! But for a newer site like HollywoodInToto.com read the 'About Us' page and scan the most recent posts. If a PR contact can't help for any reason, that's fine. Just let the reporter know they came up empty this time, but next time hopefully will be different. I use social media constantly for inspiration. But I greatly prefer not to be pitched directly on them. You can reach out to me, engage in a conversation, but always follow up with a standard pitch.""[CR-LF][CR-LF]Career:[CR-LF]2015 (November) - present - Editor, HollywoodInToto.com[CR-LF]2016 (December) - The Hollywood In Toto Podcast, Host[CR-LF]2015 (May) - 2015 (November) - LifeZette.com, Pop culture Editor[CR-LF]2014 (August) - 2015 (April) - HollywoodInToto.com, Editor[CR-LF]2012 (October) - 2014 (August) - Breitbart News, Assistant Editor | Reporter | Copy Editor | Writer | Writing Coach | Radio Commentator | TV Guest[CR-LF]2011 - 2014 - Breitbart News, Assistant Editor[CR-LF]2011 (April) - 2011 (October) - The Daily Caller, Freelance contributor[CR-LF]2011 (January) - 2011 (October) - Box Office Magazine, Freelance contributor[CR-LF]2009 (May) - 2011 (October) - Box Office Magazine, Freelance contributor[CR-LF]2008 (July) - 2011 (October) - What Would Toto Watch?, Editor of whatwouldtotowatch.com[CR-LF][CR-LF]Broadcast Film Critics Association (Member)[CR-LF][CR-LF]Education:[CR-LF]Radford University, B.S. in Art, art[CR-LF]Fashion Institute of Technology, Associates degree, illustration[CR-LF][CR-LF]Before sending press releases, story ideas or other information to a blog/blogger, we recommend you read the site thoroughly in order to understand the blogger's area of interest and point of view.
