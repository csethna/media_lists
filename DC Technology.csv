"Leslie","Cook","NPR/National Public Radio","Senior Business Editor, Business Desk","Business","","Cook is a Senior Business Editor for the National Desk who covers Business and Finance. He focuses primarily on U.S. and international economic policy, corporate productivity, technology, workplace benefits and competitiveness in American business. He wants business stories that are timely and that interest a broad-based, savvy, business-minded audience. Try to tie your pitch into current economic trends. He does not want what he calls mass market pitches. He prefers that your guest or expert have some broadcast experience. He'll usually conduct a pre-interview to see if they are comfortable on the air. He'll only use them if they sound good. He does not want pitches on books on management issues. [CR-LF][CR-LF]Cook says that although they don't cover individual small businesses very often, they will feature a story on a small business if there's a larger issue involved. For instance, they featured a small start-up company interested in building a community on the web. They sell t-shirts designed by artists. As members, artists get cash prizes if their design is selected by the company. The story's angle of a company wanting to build a community of artists via the web caught Cook's attention. He prefers to be contacted via e-mail. Weekday afternoons between 12pm and 5pm are the best time to reach him.[CR-LF][CR-LF]Career:[CR-LF]Present - National Public Radio, Senior Business Editor, National Desk[CR-LF]1991 - National Public Radio, Supervising Senior Editor[CR-LF]1982 - NPR, Associate Producer, Acquisitions Unit[CR-LF]KCUR-FM (Kansas City), Reporter[CR-LF][CR-LF]Education:[CR-LF]Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, M.A. international public policy","","","","","Radio network","lcook@npr.org","1(202) 513-2774","","(202) 513-3329","1111 N Capitol St NE","","Washington","DC","20002-7502","United States","English","","","","","","","","","","","","1111 N Capitol St NE","","Washington","DC","20002-7502","United States","National","http://www.npr.org","Public"

His thesis research included the management of rapidly declining groundwater resources in Northern China, and the application of dynamic game theory to the study of user behavior in water markets. While at Davis his research also included the bionomics of resistance to antibiotic use in infected populations, and the application of information-theoretic methods to the estimation of agricultural production and natural resource models.

"Stacy","Palmer","Chronicle of Philanthropy, The","Editor","Associations and Non-Profits; Philanthropy; Volunteer Organizations","","Palmer is the Editor and covers all aspects of Philanthropy, including Grants, Fundraising, Management of an Organization, Personnel Moves, Technology and Foundation/Charity News for Chronicle of Philanthropy. When pitching a story, remember that the bottom line for them is how many of their readers are going to be affected. Send them News and Trends in the Philanthropy Spectrum. They are also interested in articles that offer Tips to their readers about Running a Successful Philanthropic Organization. They're more interested in quality than quantity; they won't report on every development at an organization, but when they do report about something, they tend to take a more in-depth look than most general publications. Make sure to know what makes a story unique or an organization different from other nonprofits, because the staff will ask. It also helps to be forthcoming with information; they are a bit wary of organizations that keep certain aspects of their operations secret. When they cover Gifts and Grants, they are usually for at least $1 million and $10,000, respectively. Yet, they will cover smaller ones if there is something different about them or if they go to a unique place. The staff prefers contact via e-mail, and a follow-up e-mail is OK if they do not respond. Do NOT call unless it's absolutely necessary. Contact the assistant managing editor with media inquiries. Also keep in mind that stories with the following topics should be e-mailed to these addresses: Gift Announcements, gifts@philanthropy.com; Grants, grants.editor@philanthropy.com; Conference, Workshop and Seminar Announcements, datebook@philanthropy.com; and Personnel News, people@philanthropy.com.[CR-LF][CR-LF]Career:[CR-LF]1988 - Present - The Chronicle of Philanthropy, Editor[CR-LF]1984 - The Chronicle of Higher Education, Senior Editor[CR-LF][CR-LF]Publications:[CR-LF]2004 - Challenges for Philanthropy and Nonprofits: The Courage to Change[CR-LF][CR-LF]Education:[CR-LF]1982 - Brown University, B.A. International Relations","","stacypalmer","","21049","Magazine, trade/industry","stacy.palmer@philanthropy.com","1(202) 466-1225","","(202) 466-2078","1255 23rd St NW Ste 700","","Washington","DC","20037-1146","United States","English","","","","","","","","","","","","1255 23rd St NW Ste 700","","Washington","DC","20037-1146","United States","Washington, DC","http://www.philanthropy.com","Public"

She covers rock and pop music of national significance and is interested in receiving press releases and CDs. Topics of interest include the business of the entertainment industry and musicians of national interest. She is NOT interested in receiving pitches related to music but not actually about bands, which she describes as, ""technology related to music delivery, music players, things like that. Also, we don't do jazz. Sending a CD greatly increases your chances of my paying attention to the pitch.""[CR-LF][CR-LF]Szaroleta dislikes mass-distributed press information, particularly, ""PR people who blanket-bomb with press releases."" She says, ""I know e-mail is cheap, but I get annoyed if I'm bugged with releases about things they know I'm not going to go for. I'm more inclined to ignore those borderline stories that maybe I might pick up. I feel like they just make up a media list and send everything to everyone, just in case theres a bite.""
